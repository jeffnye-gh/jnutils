what this needs is a bidirectional handshake between jndbg
and the data generator. 

three files, the data file, a 'produced' file, and a 'consumed' file

produced is a single byte written by the producer after
data has been written.

the consumer wakes up on produced, deletes produced
and consumes the data. the consumer creates the 'consumed'
key file.

consumed is a single byte written by the consumer after
data has been processes.

the producer wakes up on 'consumed', deletes consumed,
generates data, writes 'produced'.
