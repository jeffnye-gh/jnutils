# jnutils

A small collection of idioms, higher design patterns and structures that I 
use often in my code, recorded here to save me typing them in every time 
and as a central location for the source as I make improvements.

Most of this is my code from scratch, in the few cases I have credited
the original source to the best of my memory.

You might find this useful.
