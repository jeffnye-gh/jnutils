# Qt6 example code

These are examples I have created or modified, not examples from the Qt6 
distribution.

This is the Model-View-Controller pattern. The controller portion is not in
this version. The data model is contained in the json file. The view
is qt6 darkstyle/frameless window. 

The data.json supplied needs to be edited for correct ip addresses. This
also presumes you have copied your keys to known_hosts on the target 
machines.

The original darkstyle sheet and frameless window code came from:
https://github.com/Jorgen-VikingGod/Qt-Frameless-Window-DarkStyle
I have modified the original files and removed the ones I do not use.
